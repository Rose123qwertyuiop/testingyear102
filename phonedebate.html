    <h1>I think we should not be aloud our phones in class.</h1>

    </p>

    <p> The main reason is because they are a distraction from class. They distract the students using them and the others around them. Many students don't concentrate on their work and go on their phone instead. This causes them to not know what they are meant to be learning and they have to rely on others in their class to tell them what they need to learn or they just don't bother to learn it. </p>
    <p>I think that all phones should be in your bag or locker, this would also reduce the risk of people losing their phone or leaving them around the school. Students can all so use them to cheat in tests or send others photos of the test, this is unfair on other students and they could have bad consequences.</p>
